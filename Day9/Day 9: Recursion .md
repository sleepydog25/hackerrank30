Recursive Method for Calculating Factorial  

                 1       N<=1  
                 
 Factorial(N) {  
 
                 N * Factorial(N-1)           otherwise

                 
# Function Description
Complete the factorial function in the editor below. Be sure to use recursion.

# factorial has the following paramter:

int n: an integer
# Returns

int: the factorial of 
# Note: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of .

# Input Format

A single integer,  (the argument to pass to factorial).

# Constraints
2<= n<=12
Your submission must contain a recursive function named factorial.
